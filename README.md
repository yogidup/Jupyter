# 📘 My Public Jupyter Projects

Welcome to my collection of public Jupyter Notebook projects!  
This repository serves as a learning journal and a growing portfolio where I explore:

- 🤖 Practical machine learning workflows
- 📊 Data analysis & visualization in Python
- 🧹 Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques
- 🧪 Lightweight experiments and public-ready case studies

Whether you're just starting out or looking for clean, real-world notebooks to reference, feel free to browse, learn, and adapt anything here.

## 🧠 What's Inside

Each notebook is:
- Structured and well-documented
- Focused on a specific dataset or objective
- Designed to be easy to follow and reproducible

You’ll find projects ranging from simple regression to more exploratory data analysis (EDA), all written in Python and powered by libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

## 🚀 Sample Project: House Price Prediction

A full end-to-end machine learning workflow using the Ames Housing Dataset:
- Data exploration
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Correlation analysis
- Training & evaluating a linear regression model
- Visualizing predictions
- Notes on real-world implementation

## 🔧 Getting Started

You can open any `.ipynb` file directly in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  
Each project is self-contained and requires only standard Python libraries.
